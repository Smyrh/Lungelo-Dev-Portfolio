<h3>ELEPHANT</h3>
<p>Elephants are the biggest terrestrial animals , they are found mostly in dense forests and are always found in groups. </p>
<p>Three living species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.</p>
<p>The elephants are black in colour with a small tail, two big ears, thick legs, a trunk, and two little eyes. The teeth of elephants are very costly and are referred to as tusks. </p>
<strong><p>They are found most often in savannas, grasslands, and forests, but they occupy a wide range of habitats, including deserts, swamps, and highlands in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Asia </p></strong>
<p>You will find the elephants at pen E22 in our zoo, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>
