<h3>LION</h3>
<p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera, native to Sub-Saharan Africa and India.It has a muscular, broad-chested body; a short, rounded head; round ears; and a dark, hairy tuft at the tip of its tail.</p>
<p>It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides.</p>
<p> he lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. </p>
<p>One of the most widely recognised animal symbols in human culture, the lion has been extensively depicted in sculptures and paintings, on national flags.</p>
<strong> the lion ranged throughout Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s.</strong>
<p>At the Zoo the lions can be found at near the fountains with the big trees next to them.</p>
