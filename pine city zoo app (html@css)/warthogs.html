<h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
<p>warthogs (pronounced wart-hog) has two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus, but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, the common warthog (or simply warthog), is Phacochoerus africanus.</p>
<p>Although covered in bristly hairs, a warthog's body and head appear largely bare, from a distance, with only a crest of hair along the back and the tufts on the face and tail being obvious. The English name "wart"-hog refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males. </p>
<p>The males also have very prominent tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches (25 to 64 centimetres); females' tusks are always smaller </p>
<p>They are largely herbivorous, but, like most suids, opportunistically eat invertebrates or small animals, even scavenging on carrion.</p>
<strong>They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa.</strong>
<p>The warthogs can be seen at the zoo ,they are behind the theatre. </p>
