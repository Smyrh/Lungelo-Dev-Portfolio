<p>Female giraffe give birth while standing, with their young dropping about 2 meters to the ground. Remarkably, within an hour of birth, these calves can stand on their own.</p>
<p>The giraffe's distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, horn-like ossicones, and spotted coat patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with its closest extant relative, the okapi </p>
<strong><p>The  Giraffe's scattered range extends from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south and from Niger in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse at heights most other ground-based herbivores cannot reach.</p></strong>
