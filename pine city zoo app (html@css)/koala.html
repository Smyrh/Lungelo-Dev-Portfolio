<h3>KOALA</h3>
<p>The koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), sometimes inaccurately called the koala bear, is an arboreal herbivorous marsupial.It is the only extant representative of the family Phascolarctidae. Its closest living relatives are the wombats. </p>
<p> Koalas are largely sedentary and sleep up to twenty hours a day. They are asocial; only mothers bond to dependent offspring. Adult males communicate with bellows that intimidate rivals and attract mates. </p>
<p>Koalas typically inhabit open Eucalyptus woodland, as the leaves of these trees make up most of their diet.</p>
<p> This eucalypt diet has low nutritional and caloric content and contains toxic compounds that deter most other mammals from feeding on them.</p> 
<strong>The koala is native to Australia , because of their distinctive appearance, koalas, along with kangaroos, are recognised worldwide as symbols of Australia.</strong>
<p>You will find the Giraffes at pen E25 in our zoo, across the amphitheatre.</p>
