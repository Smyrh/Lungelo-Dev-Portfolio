<h3>MONKEY</h3>
<p>Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the infraorder Simiiformes, also known as simians. Traditionally, all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys except the apes.</p>
<p> Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons.</p>
<p> Apes emerged within monkeys as sister of the Cercopithecidae in the Catarrhini, so cladistically they are monkeys as well. </p>
<p>In 1812, Ã‰tienne Geoffroy grouped the apes and the Cercopithecidae group of monkeys together and established the name Catarrhini, "Old World monkeys.</p> 
<strong> Monkeys are found in both the Old World (Africa and Asia) and the New World (Central and South America). Old World monkeys are primarily found in Africa and Asia, while New World monkeys are found in the tropical regions of Central and South America.</strong>
<p>In our Zoo you can see the monkies at the monkey trail , near the fast food stop.</p>
